# Couchbase PHP Client

This library allows you to connect to a Couchbase cluster from PHP.
It is a native PHP extension and uses the very fast libcouchbase library to
handle communicating to the cluster over the Couchbase binary protocol.

## Installing

This iteration of the Couchbase PHP client is not currently available via
PECL, and as such must be compiled manually in order to be used.  The extension
will become available via PECL once it leaves the DP phase.  Until then, you may
install by downloading a prebuilt binary of the DP available on couchbase.com
for the Windows platform, or by checking out the repository and building
it directly:

```bash
phpize
./configure --enable-couchbase
make && make install
```


## Introduction

Connecting to a Couchbase bucket is as simple as creating a new Connection
instance.  Once you are connect, you may execute any of Couchbases' numerous
operations against this connection.

Here is a simple example of instantiating a connection, setting a new document
into the bucket and then retrieving its contents:

```php
  $cluster = new CouchbaseCluster('192.168.7.26');
  $db = $cluster->openBucket('default');
  $db->upsert('testdoc', array('name'=>'Frank'));
  $res = $db->get('testdoc');
  var_dump($res->value);
  // array(1) {
  //   ["name"]=>
  //   string(5) "Frank"
  // }
```
